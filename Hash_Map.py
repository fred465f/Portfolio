Hash map: A key-value store that uses an array and a hashing function to save and retrieve values.
Key: The identifier given to a value for later retrieval.
Hash function: A function that takes some input and returns a number.
Compression function: A function that transforms its inputs into some smaller range of possible outputs.

Recipe for saving to a hash table:
- Take the key and plug it into the hash function, getting the hash code.
- Modulo that hash code by the length of the underlying array, getting an array index.
- Check if the array at that index is empty, if so, save the value (and the key) there.
- If the array is full at that index continue to the next possible position depending on your collision strategy.

Recipe for retrieving from a hash table:
- Take the key and plug it into the hash function, getting the hash code.
- Modulo that hash code by the length of the underlying array, getting an array index.
- Check if the array at that index has contents, if so, check the key saved there.
- If the key matches the one you're looking for, return the value.
- If the keys don't match, continue to the next position depending on your collision strategy.

In Python we don’t have an array data structure that uses a contiguous block of memory. 
We are going to simulate an array by creating a list and keeping track of the size of the list with an additional integer variable. 
This will allow us to design something that resembles a hash map. This is somewhat elaborate for the actual storage of a 
key-value pair, but it helps to remember that the purpose of this lesson is to gain a deeper understanding of the structure 
as it is constructed. For real-world use cases in which a key-value store is needed, Python offers a built-in hash table implementation 
with dictionaries.

Following hash map, needs:
    -   Method to delete a key-value pair
    -   Refactoring of repetitive code
    -   Resolve problem of adding key-value pair to full hash map
